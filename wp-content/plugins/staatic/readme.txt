== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How will Staatic improve the performance of my site? =

Staatic transforms your dynamic WordPress site into a streamlined static site. Starting at the homepage or a designated URL, Staatic uses a web crawler to methodically navigate through every link, post, and page. As it moves through the site, dynamically generated content is captured and converted into static HTML files, while simultaneously fetching related assets like images and scripts.

By eliminating both WordPress and PHP from the delivery process, pages from your site are served instantly, bypassing the delay of on-the-fly generation. This guarantees the quickest possible load times and significantly reduces the time to first byte (TTFB), offering an unparalleled browsing experience for your visitors and enhancing your site’s SEO positioning.

= Why not use a caching plugin? =

Caching plugins boost site performance by storing data for quicker access, yet they don’t fully bypass WordPress, introducing some latency. Additionally, after every update, these plugins need cache prewarming to serve the first requests quickly. In contrast, static sites are always ‘warmed up’, ensuring consistently rapid load times.

Furthermore, with Staatic, you gain the flexibility to host your site on any platform of your choice. This means you could opt for an ultra-fast cloud provider or a robust content delivery network, further amplifying your site’s performance and ensuring optimal user experience.

= Will the appearance of my site change? =

No, it shouldn’t. However, if there is a difference in the static version of your site, it might be due to invalid HTML in your original WordPress site that couldn’t be accurately converted. In such instances, consider checking your HTML’s validity using services like the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

= How will Staatic improve the security of my site? =

By converting your site into static HTML pages, you substantially minimize the potential attack surface. This strengthens your website’s security and reduces the ongoing need to update WordPress, its plugins, and themes constantly. As a result, you can enjoy greater peace of mind, knowing your site is resilient to most threats.

= Is Staatic compatible with all plugins? =

Not entirely. When your site undergoes conversion to a static format, dynamic server-side functionalities become unavailable. As a result, plugins relying on these features – such as those processing forms or fetching external data – might not function immediately or might be unsupported altogether.

To accommodate such features, adjustments or alternatives may be necessary. Alternatively, you can opt for Staatic Premium, which seamlessly integrates some of these functionalities. For detailed insights, visit [staatic.com](https://staatic.com/wordpress/).

= Will Staatic function on shared or heavily restricted servers? =

Staatic offers broad compatibility, only requiring the permissions to write to the working directory and to initiate an HTTP connection with your dynamic WordPress installation.
